# ü©∫ Medical Report Generator

Automated Medical Report Generation from Radiology Images using Pretrained Deep Learning Models with Fine-Tuning

---

## üî• Project Overview

This cutting-edge project combines state-of-the-art **computer vision** and **natural language processing** techniques to revolutionize how medical reports are generated from radiological images. Leveraging pretrained deep learning models fine-tuned on domain-specific data, the system automates the interpretation of complex medical images and produces **accurate, detailed, and clinically relevant reports**.

The solution integrates a robust **Flask backend** that orchestrates model inference and data processing with an intuitive **React frontend** that streamlines user interaction, making advanced AI accessible to medical professionals without deep technical knowledge.

## üöÄ Key Features & Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Multi-Model Ensemble:**  
  The backend runs a collection of pretrained models, fine-tuned for specific tasks including:
  - Rib fracture detection
  - Pneumonia and COVID-19 classification
  - Tuberculosis localization and detection
  - Tumor detection, localization, and malignancy classification
  - Anatomical segmentation (ribs, lungs, heart)
  - Pulmonary artery enlargement identification

- **Dynamic Model Selection:**  
  Users can manually select which models to apply or rely on an automated LLM-driven system to analyze clinical notes and choose relevant models accordingly.

- **Feature Vector Extraction:**  
  Images are passed through selected models to extract high-dimensional feature vectors, which capture both local pathology and global anatomical context.

- **Advanced Report Generation with Fine-Tuned LLM:**  
  The extracted features feed into a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which synthesizes coherent, structured medical reports based on imaging findings.

- **Template-Based Document Generation:**  
  Generated reports are formatted into professional templates, allowing export as **PDF** or **Word documents** for easy sharing, printing, and archiving.

- **Interactive and User-Friendly Frontend:**  
  The React interface supports:
  - Drag-and-drop image upload
  - Real-time model inference progress visualization
  - Editable generated reports
  - Download and export options

- **Extensibility & Modularity:**  
  The modular design allows effortless integration of new models, report templates, or additional medical imaging modalities.

## üß† Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)

- **Model Orchestration Layer:**  
  Coordinates image preprocessing, model selection, inference execution, and postprocessing.

- **Feature Extraction Modules:**  
  Encapsulate each pretrained model, handling input normalization and output vectorization.

- **Report Generation Pipeline:**  
  Employs a fine-tuned LLM enhanced with LoRA to translate feature vectors into natural language clinical narratives.

- **API Endpoints:**  
  Provide secure RESTful interfaces for the frontend to submit images, request inference, and retrieve generated reports.

### Frontend (React)

- **Image Upload & Preview:**  
  Allows users to upload multiple image formats and preview before submission.

- **Model Configuration:**  
  Enables manual selection or automatic configuration of model inference.

- **Report Editor:**  
  Displays generated reports with options for manual corrections, annotations, and saving.

- **Export & Sharing:**  
  Supports exporting reports as professional PDFs or editable Word files, integrated with template placeholders.

## ü©ª Workflow Summary

1. **Input Collection:**  
   Radiological images are uploaded via the web interface. Clinical notes or case details can be entered manually or through voice input.

2. **Model Activation:**  
   Based on user input or automated analysis, the system activates relevant pretrained models for inference.

3. **Inference & Feature Extraction:**  
   Each model processes the image to detect pathologies, segment anatomical structures, or classify disease states, outputting feature embeddings.

4. **Vector Embedding Fusion:**  
   Feature vectors from multiple models are combined to create a comprehensive image representation.

5. **LLM-Driven Report Generation:**  
   The fine-tuned LLM receives the fused embeddings and generates a clear, structured medical report with clinical impressions and findings.

6. **Report Formatting & Export:**  
   The narrative is embedded into a Word template, allowing users to download or print the final report as PDF or DOCX.
